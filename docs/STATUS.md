# Build Status

Cross-session progress tracker. **`/poker` reads this first and updates it last.**

Plan: `BUILD-PLAN.md` · Rules: `RULES.md` (rev 9) · Skill: `.claude/skills/poker/SKILL.md`

State markers: `☐` not started · `◐` in progress · `☑` done

## Current state

**Next packet: P2, P3 or P4 — all three are unblocked and mutually independent.** No blockers.
Pick by appetite: **P4** (sets) is the smallest, **P2** (money designation) is small and
self-contained, **P3** (runs) is the hardest packet in the plan and wants a fresh session.

P0 and P1 are done. The 2023 implementation is gone from the tree and lives only at the
`pre-rewrite` tag. The solution is three projects — `BurmesePoker.Domain` (pure rules),
`BurmesePoker.Console` (Spectre-less placeholder until P8), and `BurmesePoker.Tests`
(references **Domain only**).

Domain now holds `Cards/{Rank,Suit,CardColor,CardText,CardId,Card,Deck,DeckBuilder,
DeckExhaustedException}` and `Melds/MeldKind`. The card model and the 108-card shoe are real;
nothing above them exists yet.

✅ **Baseline green** — `dotnet build` clean, `dotnet test` **60 passed, 0 failed**.
**Any red tree is a real problem.**

## Packets

| | Packet | Depends on | Notes |
|:-:|---|---|---|
| ☑ | **P0** Restructure and salvage | — | done 2026-08-18 |
| ☑ | **P1** Cards, deck, identity | P0 | done 2026-08-18 |
| ☐ | **P2** Money designation and ownership | P1 | **ready** — see the turned-up-joker default below |
| ☐ | **P3** Run candidate generation | P1 | **ready** — ⚠️ hardest; read `docs/spec/RUN-CANDIDATES.md` first |
| ☐ | **P4** Set candidate generation | P1 | **ready** — easiest of the three |
| ☐ | **P5** Exact-cover hand evaluator | P3, P4 | |
| ☐ | **P6** Stakes and settlement | P1, P2 | |
| ☐ | **P7** Round and turn engine | P5, P6 | |
| ☐ | **P8** Console front end | P7 | |
| ☐ | **P9** End-to-end play | P8 | |
| ☐ | **P10** Bot opponents and hints | P9 | optional |

**P2, P3 and P4 are mutually independent** — once P1 is done, pick whichever suits the session.

## Notes for the next session

*Anything a cold context would need: decisions taken, surprises, deliberate leftovers.*

**From P1 (most recent):**

- **Build cards with `Card.Ranked(id, rank, suit)` and `Card.Joker(id, color)`**, not the
  positional constructor. They derive `Color` from `Suit`, so a card cannot be given a colour
  that contradicts its suit. The positional constructor stays public because §3.1 specifies
  it; the factories are the ergonomic path.
- **`Deck.TwoDecks()`** builds the 108-card shoe in one call. `Deck.Cards` is a **live**
  read-only view, top first — `.ToList()` it before drawing or shuffling if you need a
  snapshot. `Deck` copies the cards it is constructed with.
- **Index 0 is the top of the deck.** `DrawFromTop` takes index 0; `DrawFromBottom` takes the
  last. Both matter at setup: `RULES.md` §3 step 4 turns up one money card from the **bottom**
  and one from the **top**.
- **`DeckExhaustedException`** (in `Domain/Cards/`) derives from `Exception` directly, not
  `InvalidOperationException`, so an empty draw pile is distinguishable from a bug. **P7 must
  reuse it rather than inventing another** — BUILD-PLAN P7 has been amended to say so. P9 is
  where it actually gets caught and turned into the discard-pile reshuffle (`RULES.md` §5).
- **Shuffling is `Random.Shuffle(Span<T>)`** over `CollectionsMarshal.AsSpan`, not
  `OrderBy(r.Next())`. Don't "simplify" it back — the old form is not a uniform permutation.
- **New rules question, `RULES.md` §9 #11 — a turned-up joker.** `SameValueAs` compares
  colour as well as rank and suit, which is a no-op for ranked cards but discriminates
  jokers by colour. Nothing says what a joker turned up as one of the two money cards
  designates, and it will happen about one round in fourteen. **Safe default for P2: no
  special case — designate by `SameValueAs` like any other card**, so a turned-up red joker
  designates the two red jokers and neither black one. Phrased neutrally in
  `QUESTIONS-FOR-MYA-LAY.md`. **Do not block on it.**
- P1 shipped 32 tests (60 total). No surprises in the packet itself — it was mechanical.

**Still current, from P0:**

- **Run the app with `dotnet run --project BurmesePoker.Console`**. `Program.cs` is a
  one-line placeholder; P8 rebuilds the front end.
- `MoneyCardStatus` and `PlayerAction` were deliberately **not** ported — superseded by
  `MoneyCardRegistry.Multiplier` (P2) and `TurnAction` (P7). `CardPlayType` became
  `Melds/MeldKind`.
- `UserPromptFactory` was deleted with the rest of `Logic/`. **P8 should read it from the
  `pre-rewrite` tag:** `git show pre-rewrite:BurmesePoker/Logic/Factories/UserPromptFactory.cs`.
- `CardText.ParseRank` is still uncalled by the domain. It is expected to earn its keep
  building hands in P3/P4 test fixtures.
- **All three projects target `net10.0`** and the solution file is **`BurmesePoker.slnx`**.
  Both were chosen deliberately: Nick's standing preference is the newest supported .NET
  tooling. Don't "fix" either back. Tests are **xunit v3 4.0.0** on
  **Microsoft.Testing.Platform**; `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` and `coverlet.collector` are gone,
  and so are `xunit.runner.visualstudio` and the coverage collector — nothing needs them.
  The Console project has **no `Spectre.Console` reference**; **P8 adds it back** at the
  current version.
- **Two MTP consequences a cold session will trip over:**
  1. `global.json` opts `dotnet test` into MTP mode. **Do not delete it** — without it
     `dotnet test` fails outright.
  2. **Filtering is `--filter-method "*Name*"` / `--filter-class "*Name*"`.** VSTest's
     `--filter "FullyQualifiedName~Name"` is rejected.
- The test project is `<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>` — expected for xunit v3, not a mistake.
- **`BUILD-PLAN` §5 P3's "Done when" said 8 candidates** while the packet body said 5. It was
  amended to **5** in P0, along with the same stale 8 in the §8 risk table.
  `docs/spec/RUN-CANDIDATES.md` was already correct.

---

## Decisions needed from Nick

**None. Every blocking rules question is closed** (`RULES.md` rev 9). P0 through P9 can all
proceed without further input.

The items left in `RULES.md` §9 are fidelity questions with safe defaults already recorded in
`BUILD-PLAN.md` — the discard exception, jokers per meld, whether the money-card claim recurs
each round, whether a pure sequence is required, and (new in rev 9) what a turned-up joker
designates. `QUESTIONS-FOR-MYA-LAY.md` has them phrased ready to ask.
**Do not block on them.**

## Session log

| Date | Packet | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-18 | P1 | ☑ Done. `CardId`, `Card` (record struct: `==` is instance identity, `SameValueAs` is value identity), `DeckBuilder.BuildTwoDecks()` → 108 cards with sequential ids, `Deck` (draw from either end, Fisher–Yates shuffle), `DeckExhaustedException`. Build clean, **60 passed / 0 failed** (32 new). Raised `RULES.md` §9 #11 (turned-up joker) and amended BUILD-PLAN P1, P2 and P7. |
| 2026-08-18 | P0 | ☑ Done. Tagged `pre-rewrite`, then deleted `Models/`, `Logic/` and `Common.cs`. Solution restructured to Domain/Console/Tests. Salvaged the enums and display tables into `Cards/{Rank,Suit,CardColor,CardText}` and `Melds/MeldKind`. Build clean, **28 passed / 0 failed**. Amended P0's acceptance (tests, not zero tests) and P3's "Done when" (5 candidates, not 8). |
| 2026-08-18 | — | Rules reconstructed from a codebase abandoned in 2023. `RULES.md` reached rev 8 with all blocking questions closed. Rewrite decided (`BUILD-PLAN.md` §1); 11 packets defined. `docs/spec/RUN-CANDIDATES.md` written, correcting P3's acceptance count from 8 to 5. `/poker` skill created. No code written. |
