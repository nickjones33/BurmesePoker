## Current state

**Next packet: P8 (console front end).** No blockers. Everything left is the chain
P8 → P9 → P10.

P0 through P7 are all done, so **the entire game exists except a way to play it**. A round
runs end to end in tests: deal, turn up the money cards, take turns, declare, settle — with
no console anywhere near it. The 2023 implementation is gone from the tree and lives only at
the `pre-rewrite` tag. The solution is three projects — `BurmesePoker.Domain` (pure rules),
`BurmesePoker.Console` (a one-line placeholder until P8), and `BurmesePoker.Tests`
(references **Domain only**).

Domain now holds `Cards/{Rank,Suit,CardColor,CardText,CardId,Card,Deck,DeckBuilder,
DeckExhaustedException}`, `Melds/{MeldKind,MeldSlot,Meld,RunGenerator,SetGenerator,
MeldCandidates,HandEvaluator}`, `Money/{MoneyCardRegistry,CardOwnership,Stakes,Settlement}`,
`Play/{PlayerId,TurnAction,PlayerState,TableState,TurnContext,RoundResult,RoundEngine}` and
`Abstractions/{IPlayerAgent,IGameObserver}`. **`Melds/`, `Money/` and `Abstractions/` are
complete**; `Play/` wants only `MatchEngine`, which is P9's.

✅ **Baseline green** — `dotnet build` clean and warning-free, `dotnet test` **192 passed,
0 failed**. **Any red tree is a real problem.**

## Notes for the next session

*Anything a cold context would need: decisions taken, surprises, deliberate leftovers.*

**From P7 (most recent):**

- **`new RoundEngine(players, agents, stakes, drawOrder, round, observer)` deals in the
  constructor and `Play()` runs the turns**, so `engine.Table` is readable before the first
  turn and a setup test needs no play at all. `Play()` returns a `RoundResult` and refuses a
  second call. **`RoundEngine.Shuffled(..., Random)` is the real-game entry point.**
- **⚠️ A round is dealt from a `drawOrder`, not from a shuffle** — the 108 cards in the order
  they will leave the deck, validated as a permutation of the shoe. That is what makes a round
  scriptable: `BurmesePoker.Tests/Play/DealBuilder.cs` arranges the order so seat *s* gets
  positions *s*, *s+n*, *s+2n*…, then the turned-up top card, then the draw pile, with the
  turned-up bottom card last. **Its filler is never a money card**, so a settlement expectation
  can be worked out by hand; ask for a money card explicitly with `ThenDraw("7D")`.
- **The engine builds the shoe itself.** `Settlement.ForRound` needs the *unshuffled*
  index-aligned shoe, so `RoundEngine` calls `DeckBuilder.BuildTwoDecks()` at setup, keeps it
  as `TableState.Shoe`, and validates `drawOrder` against it. P6's warning that the caller must
  keep the builder list is now handled inside the engine — **callers pass nothing extra**.
- **`TurnContext` is the concealment rule expressed as a type**: own hand, available discard,
  draw-pile count, turned-up cards, stakes, registry, `TurnNumber`, `Taken`, `CanDeclare`,
  `YouOwn(card)`. **No `TableState`, no `PlayerState`, no `CardOwnership`** — exposing
  ownership would leak which money cards an opponent was dealt. A reflection test pins it.
- **The engine asks narrowly, so the front end needs no legality checks.** `ChooseAction` is
  asked only when a discard is available (so the opening turn just draws), `ClaimTurnedUpMoneyCard`
  only on turn 1, and `Declare` only when `HandEvaluator.TryFindCover` has already succeeded —
  the cover it found is what `RoundResult.Melds` carries, so it is never computed twice.
- **⚠️ Narrate *after* the card lands.** The conservation test caught a real ordering fault:
  raising `PlayerDrew` between `DrawFromTop` and `seat.Take` leaves an observer seeing 107
  cards. Every take now joins the hand before the event fires. Not a clone bug — but the same
  test that would have caught the 2023 clone bug caught this.
- **`IGameObserver` gained three events over BUILD-PLAN §3.5's sketch** — `PlayerTookDiscard`,
  `MoneyCardClaimed`, `PlayerDeclared` — because a pickup, a claim and a blind draw are three
  different things and only the draw confers ownership. **All methods are default no-ops.**
- **Ownership accounting is one invariant, and it is tested as one:** records == cards dealt +
  blind draws, ever. A claim records nothing, a pickup records nothing, a discard changes
  nothing. `OnlyTheDealAndABlindDrawEverConferOwnership` exercises all three routes in one
  round and asserts the count.
- **Deck exhaustion still propagates, and P9 cannot fix it by catching `Play()`.** The
  exception unwinds from mid-turn with no resume point. The reshuffle belongs inside
  `RoundEngine.TakeCard`, gathering the discard piles at the moment of drawing. **BUILD-PLAN
  P9 has been amended** — this is the one thing P7 re-planned that matters.
- **Seating is taken as given.** RULES.md §3 step 2 randomises it, but an engine that
  reshuffled its own seating could not be scripted, so P8's `Program.cs` randomises before
  constructing. The same list is what settlement is handed.
- **Two new rules questions, both defaulted, neither blocking** (`RULES.md` rev 11, and both
  phrased neutrally in `QUESTIONS-FOR-MYA-LAY.md`):
  **§9 #12** — when the opening player claims the turned-up money card, does that value still
  pay? **Default taken: yes**, designation is fixed at setup and does not move with the card;
  reversing it is one line in `TableState`'s constructor.
  **§9 #13** — may a player discard the very card they just took? **Default taken: yes**,
  nothing in §5 forbids it; it would be a single guard in `RoundEngine`.
- P7 shipped 18 tests (192 total).

**Still current, from P6:**

- **`Settlement.ForRound(players, winner, stakes, moneyCards, ownership, shoe)` →
  `IReadOnlyDictionary<PlayerId, int>`** of **net** deltas, positive to collect. Every player
  at the table appears, including zero deltas, and the deltas always sum to zero. It is a
  static class — settlement holds no state.
- **⚠️ The `shoe` parameter must be `DeckBuilder.BuildTwoDecks()` order, and this is checked.**
  Settlement resolves an owned `CardId` to a `Card` by *index*, and rejects any list where
  `shoe[i].Id.Value != i` — so **passing `Deck.Cards` throws**, because it is shuffled. That
  guard is deliberate: without it a shuffled shoe would settle the wrong cards in silence, and
  every arithmetic test would still pass. **P7 must keep the builder list it made the round's
  `Deck` from** and hand that over; `Deck` copies its cards, so the list is never disturbed.
- **Settlement is never given a hand, and a reflection test pins the parameter list** so it
  stays that way. This is RULES.md §4.4 encoded in a signature: the question is never who
  *holds* a card. The two headline tests — a money card its owner discarded, and one an
  opponent is holding — pass without any notion of a hand existing at all.
- **`Stakes` is a `sealed record`, not a struct.** A `readonly record struct` was the obvious
  reflex, but `default(Stakes)` would then be a silent $0/$0 game that still sums to zero and
  passes every property test. A class makes the omission a `NullReferenceException` instead.
  Both values must be **positive**; `Stakes.Standard` is $5 / $1.
- **The 7♦ pays *once* unless it is also turned up.** Permanent designation and turned-up
  designation are separate summands (P2), so an owned 7♦ in a round where the turned-up cards
  are something else pays `1 × MoneyCardValue`, not 2. A draft test asserted +8 for exactly
  that case and was wrong; the arithmetic is unchanged, the expectation was.
- **Guards, all `ArgumentException`:** winner not at the table, a player seated twice, an empty
  table, an ownership record naming somebody not at the table, an owned id outside the shoe,
  and the misaligned-shoe check above. **There is no no-winner settlement** — P7 rounds end on
  a declaration, and P9 reshuffles rather than ending one early.
- **Zero-sum is property-tested** over 500 randomised rounds (2–6 players, random stakes,
  random turned-up cards, up to 80 owned cards). Sample the deal with `Random.Shuffle` over a
  copy of the shoe — cards must be **distinct**, or `RecordFromDeck` rightly throws on the
  second owner of one physical card. This makes P9's match-level conservation test a test of
  *banking*, not of settlement; BUILD-PLAN P9 has been amended to say so.
- **P8 gets net deltas only** — no breakdown of round payment against side-bet, no per-card
  detail. If the console wants "−$5 for the round, +$3 in money cards" it computes the
  side-bet half itself from `ownership.Records` and `Multiplier`. BUILD-PLAN P8 amended.
- **No new rules question.** §4.3, §4.4 and §7.2 are all `PLAYER`/`EXPERT` Settled and the
  worked example is reproduced exactly; nothing needed a judgement call. `RULES.md` is
  untouched at rev 10.
- P6 shipped 26 tests (174 total).

**From P2:**

- **`MoneyCardRegistry(turnedUp).Multiplier(card)` → 0 / 1 / 2** is the whole designation API,
  and it is a pure function of the turned-up cards — no `Card` is written to, ever. The
  implementation is literally `(permanent ? 1 : 0) + (turnedUp ? 1 : 0)`, so **doubling is the
  overlap and the ceiling falls out with no clamp**: two copies of the 5♥ turned up still pay
  1, two copies of the 7♦ still pay 2.
- **The permanent designators (7♦, A♠) are two `Card`s carrying negative `CardId`s**, compared
  by `SameValueAs` like every other designator. They are values, never dealt; a negative id
  means a stray `==` against a real card can only be false.
- **The turned-up list is copied**, and any length is accepted — including empty, which the
  "permanent cards with nothing turned up" acceptance test needs. **No arity check.** If P7
  wants to insist there are exactly two, that is P7's rule to enforce at setup.
- **No joker branch was written**, per the P1 default: a turned-up red joker designates the two
  red jokers and neither black one, because `SameValueAs` discriminates jokers by colour.
  `ATurnedUpRedJokerDesignatesTheRedJokersAndNotTheBlackOnes` is the single test to change if
  `RULES.md` §9 #11 ever settles the other way.
- **`PlayerId` was brought forward from `Play/`** — `CardOwnership` needs it and P7 is a long
  way off. It is a `readonly record struct PlayerId(int Value)`. **P7 must not redefine it**;
  BUILD-PLAN P7's build list has been amended.
- **`RecordFromDeck` re-recording the *same* owner is a no-op; a *different* owner throws
  `InvalidOperationException`.** The packet allowed either "rejected or a no-op" — this splits
  it, because a genuine repeat is harmless while two owners for one physical card can only be
  a dealing bug worth surfacing. There is deliberately no transfer, clear or removal, and a
  reflection test asserts the public surface stays that way.
- **⚠️ P6 needs a card lookup, and this is the one thing that re-planned.** `Records` is keyed
  by **`CardId`** but `Multiplier` takes a **`Card`**, because designation is by value and
  ownership is by instance — the two identity notions meeting at exactly the seam BUILD-PLAN
  §3.1 predicted. So `Settlement.ForRound` must be given the shoe as well.
  **`DeckBuilder.BuildTwoDecks()` is index-aligned** (`CardId.Value` == list index), so the
  lookup is an array index — but **`Deck.Cards` is shuffled and is not**. Do *not* widen
  `RecordFromDeck` to take a whole `Card`; BUILD-PLAN §3.3 fixes its signature and ownership
  is about the physical card. BUILD-PLAN P6 has been amended.
- **`CardOwnership.Records` is a live read-only view** over the internal dictionary, in the
  same spirit as `Deck.Cards`. Snapshot it if you need one.
- **No new rules question.** The packet needed no judgement beyond the §9 #11 default P1 had
  already recorded and `QUESTIONS-FOR-MYA-LAY.md` already asks.
- P2 shipped 29 tests (148 total).

**Still current, from P5:**

- **`MeldCandidates.For(hand)` → `IReadOnlyList<Meld>`**: runs first, then the sets whose card
  set no run already covers. `HandEvaluator.IsWinning(hand)` and
  `HandEvaluator.TryFindCover(hand, out var cover)` are the win authority — **the only one**.
  Nothing else in the codebase may decide a hand has gone out.
- **`TryFindCover` returns *a* cover, never a canonical one.** Thirteen hearts in sequence come
  back as `3+3+3+4`, not as one thirteen-card run, because the search takes the first candidate
  containing the lowest uncovered card. `IsWinning` is what is settled; the shape of the cover
  is not. **P8 must not assume the tidy grouping** — BUILD-PLAN P8 has been amended.
- **A "wins only if a joker plays a card the hand holds" test cannot be built out of a run.**
  A joker can nearly always play *outward* from a run onto a rank the hand does not hold —
  below the bottom card or above the top — so a rival cover always exists in which the joker
  merely fills a gap, and a generator that never substituted for a held card would find it too.
  Blocking one end only moves the boundary a rank along, and the ace is the sole natural stop.
  **A set has no escape**: it is capped at four suits, so five fives (two decks) plus a joker
  can only cover as two three-card sets, and whichever suit the joker plays is one the hand
  holds. That is `AHandWinsOnlyByPlayingAJokerAsACardItAlsoHolds`. The run flavour is tested
  one level down, on the candidate `2♦ 3♦ [🃏] 5♦ 6♦` with the real 4♦ melded elsewhere.
- **Jokers make almost any hand winnable — mind this when writing negative tests.** With two
  spare jokers any orphan finds a set, so a hand that must evaluate `false` has to be
  joker-free or joker-poor. Two drafted "not winning" hands turned out to be winning that way.
- **Performance is a non-issue.** Three thirteen-card stress hands — the 4,032-candidate one,
  a two-deck hand holding every diamond twice, and a losing hand that forces full exhaustion —
  take about **100 ms** in total. The pinning does that work; the dead-end memo changed nothing
  measurable and is kept only as a bound.
- **No partial-cover search exists**, deliberately. `TryFindCover` is all-or-nothing. A bot's
  "largest cover found" and a player's "best so far" hint need a *scored* version of the same
  backtracking, and BUILD-PLAN P10 now says so.
- **No purity requirement is implemented** — `RULES.md` §7.1 leaves "is a pure sequence
  required" open and recommends treating it as not-a-rule. If it ever settles the other way it
  is a filter on the cover, not a change to the search.
- **Guards:** the same card instance twice throws `ArgumentException`; a hand over
  `HandEvaluator.MaximumHandSize` (64, one bit per card) throws; an empty hand is covered by no
  melds at all and returns `true`.
- **No new rules question.** P5 shipped 19 tests (119 total).

**Still current, from P4:**

- **`SetGenerator.Candidates(hand)` → `IReadOnlyList<Meld>`**, mirroring `RunGenerator` in
  every respect: eager, de-duplicated by card set, jokers taken in ascending index order.
  It walks the **four suits once per rank**, taking each suit as a held card, a joker, or
  nothing — a three-card set is a four-suit set with one suit left unfilled. That single
  formulation gives the ≥3-distinct-suits rule, the four-card maximum and joker substitution
  at once, with no subset enumeration anywhere.
- **⚠️ The two generators can emit the same card set — P5 must de-duplicate across them.**
  It happens for any meld holding **at most one real card**: `{9♦,🃏,🃏}` is a run (jokers as
  10♦ and J♦) *and* a set (jokers as 9♠ and 9♥), and `{🃏,🃏,🃏}` is both trivially. Not
  wrong — identity is the card set — but it makes the cover search try the same cover twice
  and makes `TryFindCover` report a kind arbitrarily. **`MeldCandidates.For` should
  de-duplicate with the usual set comparer and keep the run interpretation**, which is
  generated first. BUILD-PLAN P5 has been amended to say so.
- **Sets cannot explode the way runs can.** Measured worst case **639** candidates — nine
  cards of one rank split (3,2,2,2) across the suits plus all four jokers — against P3's
  4,032. The closed form is in the test: every choice of *k* real cards in distinct suits
  plus *j* jokers with 3 ≤ k+j ≤ 4. The §7 risk row now says the explosion risk is P3's alone.
- **The brute-force cross-check paid off again**, and was trivial for sets: a subset is a set
  iff it holds 3–4 cards whose real members share a rank and occupy distinct suits. Nothing
  had to be said about jokers at all — with at most four cards there is always a free suit.
- **All-joker sets are emitted**, matching P3 and `RULES.md` §9 #8's *unlimited jokers*
  recommendation. `AHandOfNothingButJokersStillMakesSets` and its `RunGenerator` twin are the
  pair to change together if that ever settles the other way.
- **No new rules question.** §6.2 was already `EXPERT`-confirmed and settled; the packet
  needed no judgement call beyond the all-joker default P3 had already taken.
- P4 shipped 18 tests (100 total).

**Still current, from P3:**

- **`RunGenerator.Candidates(hand)` returns `IReadOnlyList<Meld>`**, not the bare
  `IEnumerable<Meld>` of BUILD-PLAN §3.4 — generation is eager anyway, because
  de-duplication has to see every candidate. Deliberate; don't "fix" it to lazy.
- **`Meld` and `MeldSlot` are shared with P4 and P5.** A slot is
  `(Card Card, Rank PlaysAs, Suit InSuit)`: for a real card its own rank and suit, for a
  joker what it stands in for. A meld's **identity is `CardIds`** — never its display value.
  `Meld` validates only ≥ 3 cards and no card used twice; run/set legality is the
  generator's. `Meld.Overlaps` exists for P5.
- **Jokers are taken in ascending index order** inside the fill recursion. That is not a
  detail — it is what makes the search enumerate joker *combinations* once each instead of
  every permutation, and P4 needs the same trick.
- **De-duplicate with `new HashSet<HashSet<CardId>>(HashSet<CardId>.CreateSetComparer())`.**
  The BCL comparer does structural set equality; no custom comparer is needed.
- **Two numbers in the docs were wrong and are now measured.** All thirteen ranks of one suit
  gives **76** candidates, not 77 — `A-2-…-K` and `2-…-K-A` are the same thirteen cards. The
  joker-heavy worst case gives **4,032**, not "hundreds"; the spec and the §7 risk table both
  now say thousands. Neither is a bug: a brute-force enumeration of every subset agrees with
  the generator card set for card set.
- **A brute-force cross-check earns its keep.** `GeneratorFindsExactlyTheCardSetsThatCanFormARun`
  enumerates all 2ⁿ subsets of a hand and asks, backwards, which could fill some window. It
  is what proved the 4,032 correct rather than merely bounded. **Write the equivalent for P4.**
- **Assumption taken: all-joker melds are legal**, so `🃏🃏🃏` is a run candidate. This follows
  `RULES.md` §9 #8's *unlimited jokers* recommendation, which rev 10 widened to name the case;
  requiring one real card per meld would be a stricter rule that §6.1 nowhere states. A hand
  can hold at most four jokers, so the blast radius is five extra candidates.
  `QUESTIONS-FOR-MYA-LAY.md` asks it as a table situation. **P4 should match; P5 must not
  assume a meld contains a ranked card.**
- **Test hands come from `BurmesePoker.Tests/Hands.cs`** — `Hands.Of("2D", "3D", "RJ")`, with
  `CardId`s assigned in the order listed so duplicate copies stay distinguishable. `RJ`/`BJ`
  are the jokers. This is where `CardText.ParseRank` finally earns its keep.
- P3 shipped 22 tests (82 total).

**Still current, from P1:**

- **Build cards with `Card.Ranked(id, rank, suit)` and `Card.Joker(id, color)`**, not the
  positional constructor. They derive `Color` from `Suit`, so a card cannot be given a colour
  that contradicts its suit. The positional constructor stays public because §3.1 specifies
  it; the factories are the ergonomic path.
- **`Deck.TwoDecks()`** builds the 108-card shoe in one call. `Deck.Cards` is a **live**
  read-only view, top first — `.ToList()` it before drawing or shuffling if you need a
  snapshot. `Deck` copies the cards it is constructed with.
- **Index 0 is the top of the deck.** `DrawFromTop` takes index 0; `DrawFromBottom` takes the
  last. Both matter at setup: `RULES.md` §3 step 4 turns up one money card from the **bottom**
  and one from the **top**.
- **`DeckExhaustedException`** (in `Domain/Cards/`) derives from `Exception` directly, not
  `InvalidOperationException`, so an empty draw pile is distinguishable from a bug. **P7 must
  reuse it rather than inventing another** — BUILD-PLAN P7 has been amended to say so. P9 is
  where it actually gets caught and turned into the discard-pile reshuffle (`RULES.md` §5).
- **Shuffling is `Random.Shuffle(Span<T>)`** over `CollectionsMarshal.AsSpan`, not
  `OrderBy(r.Next())`. Don't "simplify" it back — the old form is not a uniform permutation.
- **New rules question, `RULES.md` §9 #11 — a turned-up joker.** `SameValueAs` compares
  colour as well as rank and suit, which is a no-op for ranked cards but discriminates
  jokers by colour. Nothing says what a joker turned up as one of the two money cards
  designates, and it will happen about one round in fourteen. **Safe default for P2: no
  special case — designate by `SameValueAs` like any other card**, so a turned-up red joker
  designates the two red jokers and neither black one. Phrased neutrally in
  `QUESTIONS-FOR-MYA-LAY.md`. **Do not block on it.**
- P1 shipped 32 tests (60 total). No surprises in the packet itself — it was mechanical.

**Still current, from P0:**

- **Run the app with `dotnet run --project BurmesePoker.Console`**. `Program.cs` is a
  one-line placeholder; P8 rebuilds the front end.
- `MoneyCardStatus` and `PlayerAction` were deliberately **not** ported — superseded by
  `MoneyCardRegistry.Multiplier` (P2) and `TurnAction` (P7). `CardPlayType` became
  `Melds/MeldKind`.
- `UserPromptFactory` was deleted with the rest of `Logic/`. **P8 should read it from the
  `pre-rewrite` tag:** `git show pre-rewrite:BurmesePoker/Logic/Factories/UserPromptFactory.cs`.
- `CardText.ParseRank` is still uncalled by the domain. It is expected to earn its keep
  building hands in P3/P4 test fixtures.
- **All three projects target `net10.0`** and the solution file is **`BurmesePoker.slnx`**.
  Both were chosen deliberately: Nick's standing preference is the newest supported .NET
  tooling. Don't "fix" either back. Tests are **xunit v3 4.0.0** on
  **Microsoft.Testing.Platform**; `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` and `coverlet.collector` are gone,
  and so are `xunit.runner.visualstudio` and the coverage collector — nothing needs them.
  The Console project has **no `Spectre.Console` reference**; **P8 adds it back** at the
  current version.
- **Two MTP consequences a cold session will trip over:**
  1. `global.json` opts `dotnet test` into MTP mode. **Do not delete it** — without it
     `dotnet test` fails outright.
  2. **Filtering is `--filter-method "*Name*"` / `--filter-class "*Name*"`.** VSTest's
     `--filter "FullyQualifiedName~Name"` is rejected.
- The test project is `<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>` — expected for xunit v3, not a mistake.
- **`BUILD-PLAN` §5 P3's "Done when" said 8 candidates** while the packet body said 5. It was
  amended to **5** in P0, along with the same stale 8 in the §8 risk table.
  `docs/spec/RUN-CANDIDATES.md` was already correct.

---

## Decisions needed from Nick

**None. Every blocking rules question is closed** (`RULES.md` rev 10). P0 through P9 can all
proceed without further input.

The items left in `RULES.md` §9 are fidelity questions with safe defaults already recorded in
`BUILD-PLAN.md` — the discard exception, jokers per meld, whether the money-card claim recurs
each round, whether a pure sequence is required, what a turned-up joker designates, whether a
meld may be made of nothing but jokers, and (new in rev 11) whether a claimed money card still
designates its value and whether you may throw back the card you just took. `QUESTIONS-FOR-MYA-LAY.md` has them phrased ready to ask.
**Do not block on them.**

## Session log

| Date | Packet | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-18 | P7 | ☑ Done. `TurnAction`, `PlayerState`, `TableState`, `TurnContext`, `RoundResult`, `RoundEngine`, `IPlayerAgent`, `IGameObserver`. A round deals from a validated draw order (so it is scriptable), turns up bottom-then-top, offers the claim on the opening turn only, records ownership on deals and blind draws alone, discards before revealing, and settles on a declaration. Build clean, **192 passed / 0 failed** (18 new), including the four acceptance tests — expected settlement, 13/14 hand sizes, 108 distinct cards at every event, and a claim that grants no ownership. Raised `RULES.md` §9 #12 and #13 (rev 11), both defaulted. Amended BUILD-PLAN §2, §3.5, P8 (what the engine asks the console) and **P9 (the reshuffle must go inside the engine — catching `Play()` cannot resume a round)**. |
| 2026-08-18 | P6 | ☑ Done. `Stakes` (sealed record, positive-only, `Standard` = $5/$1) and `Settlement.ForRound` → per-player net deltas: flat round value from every loser to the winner, then each **owned** money card paying its owner `multiplier × money card value` from every other player. Walks ownership records and is never given a hand — pinned by a reflection test on the parameter list. Resolves an owned `CardId` through the **unshuffled** shoe by index and rejects a shuffled one outright. Build clean, **174 passed / 0 failed** (26 new), including the §4.3 worked example and a 500-round zero-sum property test. Amended BUILD-PLAN §2, P7 (keep the builder list; one roster; a round always has a winner), P8 (net deltas only) and P9 (conservation is a banking test). |
| 2026-08-18 | P2 | ☑ Done. `MoneyCardRegistry` (pure function of the turned-up cards; permanent 7♦/A♠ as negative-id value designators; multiplier is permanent + turned-up, so doubling is the overlap and its own ceiling) and `CardOwnership` (append-only, write-once, no transfer/clear/remove — enforced by a reflection test). `PlayerId` brought forward into `Play/`. Build clean, **148 passed / 0 failed** (29 new). Re-planned P6: `Records` is keyed by `CardId` while `Multiplier` takes a `Card`, so settlement needs the shoe passed in — `DeckBuilder.BuildTwoDecks()` is index-aligned, `Deck.Cards` is not. Amended BUILD-PLAN §2, P2, P6 and P7. |
| 2026-08-18 | P5 | ☑ Done. `MeldCandidates.For` (runs, then the sets no run already consumes) and `HandEvaluator.IsWinning` / `TryFindCover` — backtracking pinned to the lowest uncovered card, candidates indexed by their lowest card, coverage carried as a bitmask so dead ends memoise. Build clean, **119 passed / 0 failed** (19 new). Found that the joker-substitution acceptance hand has to be built from a set rather than a run, and that `TryFindCover`'s cover is not canonical; amended BUILD-PLAN P5, P8, P10 and the §7 risk table. |
| 2026-08-18 | P4 | ☑ Done. `SetGenerator` — one walk over the four suits per rank, each taken as a held card, a specific joker, or nothing; de-duplicated by card set. Duplicate suits impossible by construction, so a set is at most four cards. Build clean, **100 passed / 0 failed** (18 new), including a brute-force cross-check over every subset. Measured the worst case at 639 candidates and amended the §7 risk row. Re-planned P5: the two generators collide on any meld with ≤1 real card, so `MeldCandidates.For` must de-duplicate across them. |
| 2026-08-18 | P3 | ☑ Done. `MeldSlot`, `Meld` (identity is its `CardId` set) and `RunGenerator` — window-based generation with joker substitution, jokers chosen as combinations. Reference hand yields the specified **5** candidates. Build clean, **82 passed / 0 failed** (22 new). Corrected two counts in `docs/spec/RUN-CANDIDATES.md` (76, not 77; 4,032, not "hundreds"), widened `RULES.md` §9 #8 to cover all-joker melds (rev 10), and re-planned P4 and P5 around the shared `Meld` vocabulary. |
| 2026-08-18 | P1 | ☑ Done. `CardId`, `Card` (record struct: `==` is instance identity, `SameValueAs` is value identity), `DeckBuilder.BuildTwoDecks()` → 108 cards with sequential ids, `Deck` (draw from either end, Fisher–Yates shuffle), `DeckExhaustedException`. Build clean, **60 passed / 0 failed** (32 new). Raised `RULES.md` §9 #11 (turned-up joker) and amended BUILD-PLAN P1, P2 and P7. |
| 2026-08-18 | P0 | ☑ Done. Tagged `pre-rewrite`, then deleted `Models/`, `Logic/` and `Common.cs`. Solution restructured to Domain/Console/Tests. Salvaged the enums and display tables into `Cards/{Rank,Suit,CardColor,CardText}` and `Melds/MeldKind`. Build clean, **28 passed / 0 failed**. Amended P0's acceptance (tests, not zero tests) and P3's "Done when" (5 candidates, not 8). |
| 2026-08-18 | — | Rules reconstructed from a codebase abandoned in 2023. `RULES.md` reached rev 8 with all blocking questions closed. Rewrite decided (`BUILD-PLAN.md` §1); 11 packets defined. `docs/spec/RUN-CANDIDATES.md` written, correcting P3's acceptance count from 8 to 5. `/poker` skill created. No code written. |
